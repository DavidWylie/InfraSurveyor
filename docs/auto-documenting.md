# Why Auto Document
When developing cloud infrastructure you tend to create Architecture diagrams.

These start reflecting the ideal of what should be built and may even match the initial implementation.  Over time due to pressures in development diagrams tend to get out of date.   Even with 'living' documentation it takes considerable time and effort to keep it current.

The idea of this project is to create standardised diagrams of various types for use in ci/cd pipelines (scheduled or change triggerred) based on the infrastructure that has already been deployed.  By being based on the infrastructure it should always reflect reality.

People are inherently visual creatures.  A visual representation of something is easier to talk over with a bussiness owner or project team than a textual one.  And the users might see patterns or problems in the solution which were not seen during development.

## Benefits of Auto Diagramming

Accurate diagrams exist for:
- Debugging
- Planning future work
- Auditing
- Approval of current state and new state.
